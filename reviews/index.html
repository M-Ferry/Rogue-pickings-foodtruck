            <p>I wish this truck came to my work location more! The man
               that works the truck, I think he is pretty efficient with
               orders. He's super funny and tries to keep customers
               entertained while waiting which is quite
               unique in the food truck world. He tells silly, corny, and
               hilarious one liners and is a pretty interesting person to chat
               with. The food is delicious and you get a decent amount for the
               prices ranging $5ish and up. I've had the falafel once before - but
               the Greek green goddess salad is now my personal preference it was
               very delicious! Thanks for the tastes and the entertainment!</p>


               <h3>Lacey B.</h3>
               <p>I was impressed with my chicken curry! Yes the guy does have a dry
                 sarcastic humor but you can tell he's joking. He kept my friend
                 and I laughing while making our food. He also asked what we did
                 for a living and was genuinely curious about it! I will definitely
                 go back to his truck!!</p>


                <h3>Lara S.</h3>
                <p>I don't typically write reviews unless I feel moved. I first
                  tried Rogue Pickings when I was just walking outside of East End
                  Brewing company after a brewery tour. Stephen kindly approached
                  me and asked if I'd like to try a new dish he just created.
                  I'm from California, so we eat, breathe, live tacos over there.
                  Sometimes our standards cause us to be skeptical of other type of
                  food that is unusual or considered new. However, from this food truck, I was
                  pleasantly surprised. Rogue Pickings food is unique and fresh.
                  The chicken was shredded and was well complemented by the salsa,
                  which was different from what I'm used to. Ingredients were very
                  fresh with its own mild kick. It definitely hit the spot after
                  knocking back a few brews. I feel like Stephen's generous character
                  translates into his unique and creative cuisine. It doesn't hurt they
                  sell beer as well.

                  Anyway, point of this post is that Rogue Pickings food hits the spot everytime!
                  And is perfect to have with a beer! Thanks, Rogue Pickings!

                  <p>Michael is certified taco badass. All the food is good, including
                     the exotic salad's, curry's, and even burritos. Friendly face and delicious food.
